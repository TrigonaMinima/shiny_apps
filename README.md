# Shiny Apps

This a collection of small shiny apps I made (or going to make) to learn [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/). The list of apps in this repo are listed here. To learn more about the apps (what they do and how were they developed to do what they do) head over to - [trigonaminima.github.io/shiny_apps](http://trigonaminima.github.io/shiny_apps).
